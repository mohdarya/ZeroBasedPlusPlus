# About 

ZeroBased++ is a money management and budgeting application that is meant to help the user in defining categories in a much more granular level compared to a regular budgeting app. 

This app follows an improved Zerobased budgeting system, hence the name ZeroBased++

# Details 

## Categories 
Categories are the type of expenses that the user might have, this includes things such as work spending or Groceries 
### Type
Categories are divided into the following categories: 

| Type | Details |
| ---- | ---- |
| Daily | Daily transactions are transactions that reset their available amount on a daily basis |
| Weekly | Daily transactions are transactions that reset their available amount on a Weekly basis |
| Monthly | Daily transactions are transactions that reset their available amount on a Monlty basis |
| No-Limit | These type of categories will not reset its available amount |

Unlike the regular Zero-based budgeting system this app further divides categories into Daily and Weekly types to better enable the user to have control and awareness of their spending
### Allocation
the available balance the user has must be allocated to all the categories until the un-allocated amount reaches 0. this is where the zerobased name of this budgeting system is derived from

## Transactions
Transactions are then created and assigned to each category type created by the user
